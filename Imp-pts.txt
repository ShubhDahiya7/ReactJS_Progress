  // Important pts for app.js file -
  // everything inside the return of this function based component is jsx
  // app.js file is what finally runs on our react-application
  // in jsx we use className instead of class we write in html
  // camelCasing is used while writing code
  // Everything inside {} curvy brackets is seen/resolved as js inside function component

  // git
  // push - if we want the changes that we made in files to appear on github as well
            then we push those changes after add+commit
